### Description
Eksces (Polish for unusual, over-the-top behaviour, usually not approved by the general public). The typeface letterforms comes from a personal project logotype idea. The project remained unfinished, yet the idea of the logotype was was expanded into the display typeface.

The outer geometrical construction is challenged by inner curves. The serifs are somehow randomly placed in the shapes, chanllenging the technical appearance.

Eksces consists of 3 widths (narrow, regular and wide. You can access individual widths via Stylistic Sets (OpenType features) or enjoy a mixture of all.

The typeface consists of *Latin* script and 1430 glyphs in total.
